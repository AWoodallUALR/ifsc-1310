    <h2>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h2>
    <p>
      It is important to build accessible websites because technology is
      increasingly a requirement of participating in modern society. Options
      that do not require the internet are disappearing in many cases, and this
      can lock people out of important services that they need. Employment,
      healthcare, government services, utilities, financial services, the list
      of important areas where internet access is involved and even required is
      endless. Designing websites that work with screen readers, can be
      navigated using keyboard or alternatives and that are descriptive and
      simple to navigate helps people. Imagine struggling with a limitation and
      attempting to do something as simple as paying your bills. Particularly if
      you canâ€™t leave home on your own, accessibility is the difference between
      being able to take care of a simple task independently and having to
      contact someone else and have them do it for you. A lack of accessible
      options can make people feel like the world is not designed for them and
      makes what may already be a very frustrating situation even harder. Making
      websites useable for the greatest number of people helps makes things as
      equitable as possible and gives those who may be disabled permanently or
      temporarily or challenged in some way greater autonomy and control over
      their lives.
